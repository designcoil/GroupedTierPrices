# GroupedTierPrices
Grouped Tier Prices extension will apply tier prices based on total quantity of all associated products in cart. You can add different sub-products of a grouped product to the cart and you will get the tier price for the total quantity of all sub-products in the cart.

For example you have a Knife Set grouped product with several different sizes of the same knife, like Chef's Knife 4", Chef's Knife 5" etc . The price of each knife is $10. If you buy 5 or more, tier price of each knife will be $8. In Magento, you will have to buy 5 of each knife variations in order to get discounted price. With Grouped Tier Prices extension you can buy a mix of different knives and tier price will be calculated based on total qty of knives in cart.
